                    <p class="p">Gas Suppression Systems are an essential element of any fire protection plan for
                        commercial, industrial, or institutional buildings. They are designed to quickly suppress fires
                        by reducing the oxygen concentration in the protected area, thereby extinguishing the fire
                        without causing damage to the property or equipment.

                    <p class="p">At our company, we specialize in designing, installing, and maintaining Gas Suppression
                        Systems for a variety of applications, including server rooms, data centres, museums, archives,
                        and other critical environments. Our team of experienced engineers and technicians is dedicated
                        to providing innovative, cost-effective solutions that meet your specific needs.</p>
                    <p class="p">Our Gas Suppression Systems are based on several agents, including FM-200, Novec 1230,
                        CO2, and inert gases such as Argonite, Nitrogen, and Inergen. These agents are selected based on
                        the type of fire risk, occupancy type, and the protected environment. Our Gas Suppression
                        Systems are designed to provide fast-acting, reliable protection, and are backed by
                        industry-leading warranties.
