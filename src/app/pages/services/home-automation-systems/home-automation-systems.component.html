                    <p class="p">Home automation is the use of technology to control various aspects of your home, such
                        as lighting, heating, air conditioning, security systems, entertainment systems, and appliances.
                        With the help of a central hub, sensors, and smart devices, you can control your home from your
                        smartphone, tablet, or voice commands.
