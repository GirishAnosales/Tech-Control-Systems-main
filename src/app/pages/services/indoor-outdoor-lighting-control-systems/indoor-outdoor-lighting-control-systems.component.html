                    <p class="p">In addition to smart lighting systems, we'll also discuss other advanced control
                        systems such as occupancy sensors, daylight sensors, and dimming controls. These systems can
                        help you reduce energy consumption, lower electricity bills, and create a more comfortable and
                        efficient indoor environment.</p>
